The purpose of this study is to perform content analysis of research articles using the language network analysis method in Korea and catch the basic point of the language network analysis method. Six analytical categories are used for content analysis: types of language text, methods of keyword selection, methods of forming co-occurrence relation, methods of constructing network, network analytic tools and indexes. From the results of content analysis, this study found out various features as follows.

To form co-occurrence relation between keywords, there use the co-occurrence count. The constructed networks are multiple-type networks rather than single-type ones. The network analytic tools such as NetMiner, UCINET/NetDraw, NodeXL, Pajek are used. The major analytic indexes are including density, centralities, sub-networks, etc. These features can be used to form the basis of the language network analysis method.</p>
